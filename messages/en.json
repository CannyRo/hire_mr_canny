      "2":{
        "title": "Save time",
        "content": "A work-study program enables you to assess a candidate's skills and adaptability to the company's culture and processes over an extended period, before committing to a permanent contract. This reduces the risk of poor recruitment, and saves your company time. What's more, a candidate undergoing professional retraining can draw on cross-disciplinary skills already acquired during previous experience."
      },
      "3":{
        "title": "Save energy",
        "content": "The reduction in recruitment risk mentioned above also means energy savings for your HR functions. In fact, you'll need to look for and hire fewer new employees, since the professionalization contract gives you visibility over the next 12 months. And Ironhack's added bonus: a special format with all courses running continuously over 9 weeks, leaving the student 100% trained and 100% available on the job from the moment he or she takes up the position until the end of the contract. So you don't have to worry about his or her availability, especially for your sprints."
